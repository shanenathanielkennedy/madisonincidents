Hunter Lisko,2022-000000,,https://www.cityofmadison.com/police/newsroom/incidentreports/incident.cfm?id=30162,"Recently, there has been an uptick in scams targeting elderly victims. This increasing trend has been seen in our community and others, and has many different forms.

These scams take many forms, but are typically seen when the intended victim receives a call from someone pretending to be their grandchild or a loved one. The ""grandchild,"" in reality is the scammer, and often times will sound panicked and will be asking for help. The scammer will claim that they've been in a car accident, have been arrested, or were the victim of some kind of crime. The scammer will then ask for money, usually with a demand that the victim deliver this immediately and not talk to anyone about the situation.

We have seen situations lately where the scammers will ask for cash, and send a ""courier,"" to collect the cash. Other circumstances will ask for bank or credit card information. MPD has also dealt with circumstances where the scammer asks for the victim to go to a Bitcoin ATM and complete a transaction that way.

The Madison Police Department wants to remind the community of some general safety tips related to identification and prevention of these scams.
If you are receiving a phone call from a number that you don't know and the person on the other end claims to be a relative, it is ok to hang up and try to reach that relative at a known phone number. This pause can save you the headache of being scammed!
  If someone is claiming to be in legal trouble or at a jail, ask them which jail or facility they are at. Then, make a phone call to verify if that is the case by contacting that jail/law enforcement agency directly!
  If someone asks you to complete a financial transaction at a Bitcoin ATM or other similar ATM, and this is out of the ordinary, stop and verify all information before doing so. Make calls to the person you believe is asking for money, and make sure you know the implications of such transactions.
  Remember, no government official will ask you to pay fines or fees with gift cards from Amazon, Target, or any other store. If you have been directed to purchase these items, do not read off the codes for the cards to anyone over the phone.?
  Do not give out personally identifying information, such as a bank account number or Social Security Number to a person or website you don't know and trust. 

If you or someone you know has been a victim of this kind of a scam while in the City of Madison, please contact the Madison Police Department at 608-255-2345.

The investigation revealed that the vehicle's owner, Brandon L. Jackson, suspected his ex-girlfriend, Ronnita E. Washington, of setting his vehicle on fire. Ultimately, officers were able to establish probable cause for Washington for Arson. Washington, however, was not at the scene to be immediately taken into custody.

However, Jackson and his current girlfriend, Maleasa P. Epkins, resolved themselves to find and confront Washington about this despite clear instructions from officers not to do so.

Ultimately, a confrontation occurred between the three parties at a separate location. Officers were there and able to quickly intervene in this confrontation.
All three individuals were arrested in this incident due to the initial arson and the retaliatory actions. The charges referred to the District Attorney's office are as follows:
 
Washington was arrested on one count of Arson.

Jackson was arrested on one count of Domestic Disorderly Conduct.

Epkins was arrested on one count of Disorderly Conduct, one count of Battery, and one count of Criminal Damage to Property.

All of the parties were conveyed to the Dane County Jail.

The individual often later finds that either the property does not exist (or is unavailable for rent), or the person with whom they've been speaking neither owns nor manages the property.
 
Preventative Tips:
1. Make contact in-person if possible. This will allow you to see the apartment and review the lease with the property manager.
2. Be mindful of the area code. If the phone number isn't a 608 area code, it is likely not a property manager within the city of Madison.
3. Attempt to only make contact with property managers and individuals whom are authorized to lease an apartments by using online reviews or company websites to verify.
4. Remember to be mindful of the price the apartment is listed for and compare it to market value.
5. You can report these types of incidents directly to the Federal Trade Commission as they often cross state lines.
7. Fraudsters will often target online social apps and websites, and will spend time developing rapport with their victims before convincing them to send money. They often times create that sense of urgency to get their victims to pay large amounts of money. Be cautious about persons you meet online until you're confident you know exactly who they are.
 
The MPD has taken similar reports in recent years, but it is always a good reminder to do your homework when considering renting or buying a property.

The suspect then got into her vehicle and fled the scene.

Madison Police Officers and a Sergeant arrived to investigate and were able to locate the suspect at her residence a short time later. She admitted that there was a handgun in her vehicle which was then searched by police.

Keep a current photo of your loved one that you can readily share with responding officers
Be mindful of past tendencies of your family member or friend and where they might go, who they know, and what kinds of things they like
If possible, please be prepared to share how officers can best interact with your loved one when we find them. What is helpful for them, and what is not? These things can help us thoughtfully tailor our response
Let us know about known medical conditions and medications that your loved one takes. This information is part of the criteria for certain alerts that MPD can issue, and it can inform the way we proceed with the investigation

Earlier this week, UWPD warned the community about a recent string of thefts involving mopeds and motorcycles. The agency reported six of these vehicles were stolen from multiple locations across campus.

The ATV recovered at this site was reported stolen out of Sun Prairie two weeks ago. One of the electronic bikes recovered was also reported stolen out of Florida.
 
These two items together are estimated at around $3,000.
 
MPD detectives are now starting the process of tracking down the owners of the items collected and have reunited several of the victims with their property.
 
Two people were taken into custody on outstanding burglary warrants and other charges related to burglaries and thefts.

There are ways to protect your property from similar thefts:
Secure your key in a safe place – away from mopeds, motorcycles, ATVs, etc.
Record serial numbers and take photos of items such as mopeds, bicycles, cameras and laptops in case a theft occurs
Consider purchasing an anti-theft device or lock for your moped or motorcycle
Park in visible, well-lit areas
Consider securing bikes in a garage or other secure area

In early May, a suspect broke into several businesses located in the Clock Tower Plaza on Mineral Point Road. This person stole a number of items and caused thousands of dollars in damages to these businesses.
 
A few days later, a couple arrived to work to find someone had broken into the restaurant they owned. The business had been damaged and more than $10,000 was missing from inside.
 
These are just two of the cases that our Burglary Crime Unit investigated.
 
The investigation, while still on-going, required MPD officers to process and analyze business video, utilize our partners at the Wisconsin State Crime Lab to examine forensic evidence for DNA, and access and investigate cell phone data.
 
This work has led to the arrest of Tramaine Franklin, 34, of Sun Prairie.  
 
In June, MPD and other law enforcement partners searched Franklin's apartment and found more incriminating evidence tying him to these cases.
 
In July, the Burglary Crime Unit and the MPD Gang and Neighborhood Crime Abatement Team (GNCAT) tracked Franklin to a house on the east side. After extended negotiations, and with the help of his family, Franklin surrendered and was safely taken into custody. At that time, he was charged with several burglaries.
 
Since then, an additional 11 cases have been submitted for referral to the District Attorney's Office. This brings the total to 15 commercial burglaries with additional charges for damages done to the victims.
 
It is estimated that in these cases along, there was over $17,000 in stolen items of value and $20,000 in property damage done. Nearly all of the victims were small, family business owners.

The Nolan family is also offering a new, $25,000 reward this year for any information that could lead to the conviction of her killer. This particular reward is only active for the next year. 

Kelly was last seen in downtown Madison during the early morning hours of June 23, 2007. Her body was found 16 days later, on July 9, in a wooded property along the 4700 block of Schneider Dr. in the town of Dunn.

Kelly was a 22-year-old UW-Whitewater student living in Madison for the summer. She was subletting an apartment on East Mifflin Street and searching for a part-time job.

She spent the night before her disappearance out with friends. They eventually separated and Kelly remained in the State Street area. Witness accounts place her along the 500 block of State St. between 2:20 and 2:30 a.m. on that Saturday.

Multiple veteran detectives remain assigned to this case. They continue to pursue all new leads and remain committed to finding the person or persons responsible.

They are still working to determine who may have been involved in Kelly's death and whether she left the downtown area on her own accord or forcibly.
No one is currently considered a person of interest or suspect.

Kelly was wearing an emerald green, scooped-necked shirt and jeans. She was carrying a grayish-green handbag with several outside pockets.

If you remember seeing her downtown that night or have any information regarding this case, please contact police.

All tips are investigated thoroughly. No piece of information or detail is considered too small or too insignificant. It may be what is needed for detectives to solve this case.

Information can be submitted by contacting the Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014 or online at p3tips.com.

Tips can be submitted anonymously, and people may be eligible for an additional cash reward through Crime Stoppers.

Below is a statement the Nolan family has asked the Madison Police Department to release on their behalf.

Fifteen years have passed since our beautiful daughter and sister, Kelly Nolan, was tragically taken from us. This day in our lives seems so close and yet so distant. Her legacy of kindness, humor, loyalty and intelligence are remembered daily by all those who loved her. Kelly simply had a beautiful soul, and we thank the Lord for sending her to us, even if for a shortened time. The passage of time in no way diminishes the heinousness of the crime. We are still seeking accountability and answers surrounding our daughter's death. We know there is someone out there, whether locally or elsewhere, that can shed light on what happened to Kelly during her final moments of life. Moments we were robbed of spending with her. We ask that you contact the Madison, Wisconsin, Police Department with any information you might have. No detail is too small or insignificant. Please tell police what you saw, know, heard or believe happened to Kelly. Those details just might be the information that is needed to solve this crime and bring a small bit of peace to our family. We ask that you be brave. And know coming forward will not be easy. There are ways for you to remain anonymous if you choose. We also want to take a moment to thank the Madison Police Department, who remain dedicated to solving this case and work daily to prevent other innocent young women from becoming victims. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you.

 The family of Kelly Nolan

That fraudster sent the victim photographs of a fake badge and credentials to convince the victim of their (false) law enforcement status. The fraudster used some common techniques to convince the victim to purchase multiple thousands of dollars' worth of gift cards and then share the gift card data via text message. The gift cards balances were depleted shortly thereafter. A short time later, the same victim received another phone call from someone falsely claiming to be a Madison police officer who was able to mimic the dispatch phone number so it appeared the phone call was legitimate.
 
The scam described above is one of many common fraud techniques that citizens experience across the country on a daily basis, both over the phone and online. Below are some tips to help you identify some red flags, which may help you avoid finding yourself in a similar situation:
 
-Consider third-party confirmation of information like officers' names and incident report numbers. This can help you confirm whether or not you have spoken to a real law enforcement officer; and can be done simply, with a call to your local non-emergency dispatcher or by directly contacting the agency the suspected fraudster is claiming to be from.
 
-Gift cards are never a legitimate way to resolve any government-related financial obligations, and any suggestion otherwise should be considered suspicious.
 
-When selling personal belongings or goods in online marketplaces, be weary of potential buyers with new accounts and profiles. Also, be on the lookout when potential buyers create a manufactured sense of urgency when it comes to shipping the goods, when they offer you more than the price you're asking, and when they try to suggest a payment transaction method that is more complicated than necessary. These three tactics are often employed together and will leave a victim without their goods and without payment.
 
-Fraudsters will often target online social apps and websites, and will spend time developing rapport with their victims before convincing them to send money. They oftentimes create that sense of urgency to get their victims to pay large amounts of money. Be cautious about persons you meet online until you're confident you know exactly who they are.
 
-Law enforcement will never call you to tell you have a warrant for your arrest and to demand a monetary payment to resolve the warrant. If you have any questions as to whether or not such a warrant exists, call your local police agency.
 
If you have any information regarding this incident, please contact the Madison Police Department at 255-2345.  If you wish to remain anonymous, please contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014 or online at p3tips.com.

These all occurred in Madison's West District, specifically in the neighborhoods south of McKee Rd. and west of Maple Grove Dr. 

On the evening of Oct. 4th and into the early morning hours of Oct. 5, Madison PD (largely on the east side and west side of Madison) received reports of more than forty smashed out vehicle windows, with personal property being taken from the damaged vehicles and a car being stolen by what we believe are the same suspects connected to this series of armed carjacking's. 

This trend of violent, armed carjackings, coupled with the extensive, senseless damage to property, caused many who live in these otherwise quiet Westside neighborhoods to fear for their safety. 

Video evidence, physical evidence and extensive collaboration between numerous police agencies to include Fitchburg PD, Cottage Grove PD, Waunakee PD, Middleton PD, Wisconsin State Patrol, Milton PD and Illinois authorities assisted detectives in being able to request charges on some of the suspects. 

A 16-year-old male with ties to the Madison and Rockford area was ultimately taken into custody on Nov. 4 by MPD. He is believed to be extensively involved in all of these crimes. He currently remains in custody at the Juvenile Reception Center.

Because the arrested juvenile is a minor his name has not been released. 

Last week, MPD requested a warrant from the Dane County District Attorney's office for the arrest of a 16-year-old with ties to Rockford, Ill., whom investigators believe is connected to this crime spree.

In nearly every incident, the vehicle targeted was a Toyota Prius. It also appears a select few are doing these thefts.
 
Most are happening overnight between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. The busiest time of the week is Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.
 
Officers are doing extra patrols of the impacted areas. MPD is also working on some problem-solving efforts with local partners to address this crime long-term.

(MADISON, Wis.)--The Madison Police Department (MPD) has received two community policing grants from the Office of Community Oriented Policing, U.S. Department of Justice (COPS Office), announced Chief of Police Shon. F. Barnes. ""We are grateful to be given this opportunity to develop and implement promising and creative approaches to preventing crime and promoting safety in our community,"" he said.

A Community Violence Intervention: Breaking the Cycle of Youth Violence grant award of $125,000 will fund a youth wraparound services pilot project through partner RISE Wisconsin, Inc., a local community-based organization, to break the cycle of youth from the same families committing violent crimes though providing wraparound resources to repeat juvenile offenders and family members.

 ""Many youth arrested for violent crimes have siblings that are already behind in literacy and numeracy skills and may have unaddressed trauma-related issues. Because siblings live in the same environments as their arrested siblings, we believe a focused intervention with the offenders and siblings may assist in reducing their likelihood to follow that same criminal path, and may also help lower offender recidivism,"" said Capt. Mike Hanson, the project leader.

In addition, this plan also includes specific adult intervention for those who also reside with the arrested youth. ""Adults in need of services for AODA, employment, housing, trauma and education will also receive wraparound services directly in the home,"" said Scott Strong, executive director of RISE.

A De-escalation Training for Law Enforcement Agencies grant award of $126,420 will help MPD Training Center efforts to build and maintain its officers' de-escalation proficiency through a USDOJ-approved, nationally certified de-escalation train-the-trainer course and upgraded virtual reality equipment that will be used to train MPD officers for years to come.

""MPD continues to pursue strategic investments in improving our approach to policing and crime prevention,"" said Mayor Rhodes-Conway, ""These federal grants will support advanced de-escalation training to help resolve situations without violence, and provide wrap-around resources to families of repeat juvenile offenders to support them.""

U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin supported both grant applications to the COPS Office Community Policing Development program, which awarded more than $33 million nationally in funding to advance the practice of community policing in law enforcement. ""I applaud the Department of Justice for awarding this grant funding to the Madison Police Department,"" said Senator Baldwin. ""I supported this federal funding because it will promote safety in our community. These grants will help to establish training, resources and relationships to foster mutual trust and positive, productive police interactions that will help prevent crime and violence.""

10/14/2021,Information,1710 Mckenna Blvd,P.O. Ryan Kimberley,0000-000000,,https://www.cityofmadison.com/police/newsroom/incidentreports/incident.cfm?id=28612,"The Madison Police Department's West District share concerns and are especially troubled by the relatively new escalation involving residents being confronted at gunpoint in and around their vehicles and homes. As many of you know, this is the third such incident since August 19th in a relatively small area to the South and West of McKee Rd and Maple Grove Drive. MPD believes that these three cases are related and are being committed by a small group of individuals who are becoming increasingly more brazen. These three cases are also likely related to the extensive property crime spree that took place during the overnight hours of October 5th where MPD took over 40 reports involving forced entry theft from auto, criminal damage to property, and burglaries. Finally, it appears the involved individuals have been associated with weapons offenses in Madison in recent months. 
 
To be clear, this most recent violent person and property crime spree do NOT fit within what is often referred to as crimes of opportunity. When that phrase is used, we are typically referring to unlocked and unoccupied vehicles or persons entering open unoccupied garages. Individuals involved in these cases typically have no plans of interacting with or confronting residents and generally do not engage in a forced entry or property damage. In those cases, we know that the most effective strategy is one of prevention by locking doors and keeping valuable secure and out of public view. Again, this most recent crime spree does not fit this description and no resident behavior or action is to blame for this. We collectively should not expect and should never accept criminals pointing guns at residents to take property by force. This spree is MPD's number one priority and we will do everything to bring it to an end. 
 
What are West PD and MPD doing?
 
The crime spree occurring in the South end of the West District (Aldermanic District 7) is being investigated by West PD Detectives along with the Burglary Crime Unit and the Gang Neighborhood Crime Abatement Team. Additionally, related cases are being investigated by the other MPD Districts. MPD is actively working with the Dane County Stolen Auto Workgroup as well as agencies outside of Dane County who have cases with ties to our spree. It is MPD's hope and expectation that we will have arrests in these cases to report to you all in the coming days. MPD is working with our Criminal Intelligence Section to analyze data to better inform our preventative strategies and to link cases together. While detectives work to identify, locate and arrest the persons responsible, MPD will work to increase presence in the targeted areas. MPD will do this through assigned directed patrols in the overnight hours (known as 4th and 5th Patrol Details). To bolster patrol resources who are likely to get pulled away for other in-progress priority calls for service, West PD is developing a problem-solving initiative and will soon request additional resources to increase police presence in this specific area. This is a short-term intervention and not sustainable over the long run but it is needed at this time.
 
In general, residents are always encouraged to be alert, vigilant, and to report all suspicious activity to Dane County Dispatch via 911 or the non-emergency dispatch line at 608-255-2345. MPD recommends the following until this spree has abated:

- The three carjacking cases have occurred between the hours of 11:00 PM and 2:00 AM with residents arriving home to generally empty streets. MPD's sense at this time is that suspects have a connection to this area of the city and are in the area and looking for an additional vehicle for use in their criminal activities. They appear to be watching for an alone occupant approaching a residence and typically approach immediately as the vehicle comes to a stop. This is likely done in the hope that the vehicle is still unlocked, running, or at least with keys still in the ignition or easily accessible. Be aware of your surroundings as you approach your residence and watch for occupied cars in the area. 
- Considering notifying a family member or neighbor of your arrival time and ask for someone to standby with lights on to greet you and see you safely into your residence.
- If you observe suspicious activity as you arrive to the area of your home and feel unsafe exiting your vehicle, remain in your locked car and contact Dane County Dispatch via 911 to request an officer to respond to check the area and confirm your safety.
- If parking in your garage, consider remaining in the car with the car door locked until the garage door is fully down.
- If parking on the street, in a parking lot, or a driveway, pause momentarily after coming to a stop. Keep car doors locked and monitor the area. If being approached by another vehicle, remain in your locked vehicle and consider your route out of the area should you decide that it would be best to drive away out of the area and call for assistance.
- If confronted by an armed person demanding your property, separate yourself from your property, and move slowly away from the armed suspect(s). Your personal safety is the priority in these situations. Protect yourself and do your very best to be the best possible witness you can be to pass along detailed information to the officers who will respond when notified.
- Assess the area around your home for large areas of darkness that can be addressed with additional lighting. Consider parking in the best lit area possible.
- Assess your routines, especially related to returning home in overnight hours of darkness. Give thought to your route home and where you would expect to see parked cars. Watch for occupied parked vehicles or vehicles moving slowly in the neighborhood. If you routinely arrive home between the hours of 11 PM and 2:00 am in the area recently being targeted, consider working with a family member or neighbor to have someone meet you as you arrive with additional exterior lights on. 
- As neighborhood associations or apartment complexes, increase information sharing to keep residents aware of updates to this spree and/or new criminal behavior in the area.

MPD has also received questions about security cameras and whether they are useful to MPD investigations:
- Absolutely. Video collected in these cases is used to build cases against the individuals involved, even if only to establish a timeline of incidents and to link multiple cases together. 
- This can be a time-consuming process and can at times overwhelm our resources, especially in the more prolific sprees such as the October 5th forced entry theft from auto spree, but every piece of information helps to complete the picture and move these cases along.
- When you are aware of criminal activity in your neighborhood, check your camera footage for any potentially useful video evidence. If you find something on your camera footage, contact MPD who can then assess whether we will collect it.
   
Crime prevention is everyone's responsibility, and it starts with all of us in the community working in partnership. MPD's many partnerships and efforts through our neighborhood officers, community policing teams, gang unit, and our community outreach units focus on building and strengthening relationships, especially with our youth. MPD is confident that we will collectively bring this crime spree to an end and the individuals responsible will be held accountable. Your safety is our priority and we will do everything we can to protect you and your property. Citizens are encouraged to reach out to their respective districts with questions or concerns, MPD is willing to arrange a neighborhood meeting at any time upon request.

Fortunately, no officers sustained any injury during this incident, though the squad car was damaged.

A pursuit was initiated, and the vehicle was able to evade officers due to reckless and high speed driving.

The vehicle drove in an extremely hazardous manner, mounting curbs and sidewalks to avoid tire deflation devices.

Shortly after the pursuit, MPD officers were able to locate the vehicle unoccupied on a dead end street in the City of Fitchburg, where they conducted further investigation.

Christopher S. Perrote was safely taken into custody on 9/30 and booked into the Dane County Jail for the tentative charges of 2nd Degree Reckless Endangering Safety, Disorderly Conduct while armed, and Unlawful Use of Computerized Communication Systems - all with domestic violence enhancers.

In May (21-185131), Perrote generated several calls for service reference noise complaints in and around his home. While Madison Officers were investigating one of these reports, Perrote pointed a firearm at officers through his window. In this case, Perrote did not know police were at his residence, and therefore probable cause was not established.

In August (21-353979), Perrote was involved in a domestic incident that involved pointing a gun at the victim and then discharging the firearm at a cat (unharmed). MPD's investigation revealed that Perrote made vague threats about mass killing and building bombs. The investigation found Perrote has a stockpile of weapons, ammo, gas mask, and body armor. The firearm used during this incident was later seized.

Due to numerous safety concerns to take Perrote into custody, MPD utilized the SWAT team which exceeds the capabilities of a standard MPD response for high-risk situations, ultimately providing a safe resolution. Due to the copious amount of weapons and threats made by Perrote, MPD has worked in partnership with the FBI and ATF.

Over the course of the last week, MPD and several local law enforcement agencies have been investigating several vehicle thefts from a Madison area car dealership, in addition to various burglaries. In the last 24 hours, local and statewide agencies converged and discovered that there was a common suspect – Weightman - amongst their jurisdictions, who is believed to be involved in many burglaries, identity thefts, assaults and other criminal behavior across Wisconsin and the Midwest. This subject was arrested in the 2500 block of McDivitt Rd this morning by Madison Police.
 
Stolen vehicles and large amounts of stolen property are currently being processed. MPD is working hard to identify which cases are connected to Weightman. Due to the breadth of the suspects' crimes and geographical targets, Detectives will work diligently to piece together the cases and bring justice to the victims.

This is was important work completed by numerous law enforcement agencies.  This case illustrates the importance of filing police reports when items are stolen from your possession.  Law enforcement works hard to not only arrest criminals but to return stolen items back to their rightful owner.  As part of the lengthy processing ahead, staff will match stolen items from previous police reports to the large stockpile found today.

The drone hovered for a few minutes over the fans, field, players and officials before flying off.  This is a reminder of drone use as high school and college sporting events resume outdoors throughout our area.  Per the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), drones cannot be flown over people and crowds without specific waivers the FAA provides.  The Madison Police Department understands the increased popularity of drones, however owners have a responsibility to understand the important rules setforth by the FAA to keep everyone safe.  Local law enforcement can respond to drone complaints on behalf of the FAA.  Below are rules, under Part 107, for drone operators to know:

Just as there are rules of the road when driving a car, there are rules of the sky when operating a drone.

-Always avoid manned aircraft.
-Never operate in a careless or reckless manner.
-Keep your drone within sight. If you use First Person View or similar technology, you must have a visual observer always keep your drone within unaided sight (for example, no binoculars).
-You cannot be a pilot or visual observer for more than one drone operation at a time.
-Do not fly a drone over people unless they are directly participating in the operation.
-Do not operate your drone from a moving vehicle or aircraft unless you are flying your drone over a sparsely populated area and it does not involve the transportation of property for compensation or hire.

You can fly during daylight (30 minutes before official sunrise to 30 minutes after official sunset, local time) or in twilight if your drone has anti-collision lighting. Minimum weather visibility is three miles from your control station. The maximum allowable altitude is 400 feet above the ground, higher if your drone remains within 400 feet of a structure. Maximum speed is 100 mph (87 knots).

Tuesday morning, a resident in the 3000 block of Atwood Ave woke up to loud sounds similar to mechanical tools being used. The resident saw a white SUV leave the area after discovering a catalytic converter missing from a Toyota Prius parked outside. Attached is a photo of the possible suspect vehicle. Officers contacted the Prius owner and estimate the value of the stolen catalytic converter at $1800.

On December 29th, 2020, a home security camera captured a catalytic converter theft in the 600 block of S Dickinson St. A homeowner woke up to notifications on his phone showing a car stopping next to his 2007 Toyota Prius with people proceeding to cut off his catalytic converter. This all happened in about a minute and a half. View the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR9TuTcK4uQ&feature=youtu.be

According to the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), catalytic converter thefts have been skyrocketing nationwide:
""Removing a catalytic converter takes only minutes using some basic, readily-available, battery-operated tools from a local hardware store and for the vehicle owner, it's costly due to the loss of work, finding and paying for alternate transportation and then paying anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000 to get your vehicle fixed."" - NICB

The NICB recommends vehicle owners:
Install a catalytic converter anti-theft device. These are available from various manufacturers and can provide a level of security from theft.
Park fleet vehicles in an enclosed and secured area that is well lit, locked, and alarmed.
Park personal vehicles in a garage. If not possible and vehicles must be parked in a driveway, consider installing motion sensor security lights. While lights may not provide complete security, it may make some thieves think twice, making them leave the area and your vehicle untouched.
Call local law enforcement and your insurer should you become the victim of a catalytic converter theft.

Tech support scammers want you to believe you have a serious problem with your computer, like a virus. They want you to pay for tech support services you don't need, to fix a problem that doesn't exist. They often ask you to pay by wiring money, putting money on a gift card, prepaid card or cash reload card, or using a money transfer app because they know those types of payments can be hard to reverse.

MPD has a few property crime prevention tips:
  LOCK IT
Ensure your car doors and all doors to your residence are kept locked.
REMOVE IT
Removing valuables from your car is better than hiding them.  This includes garage door openers and spare keys.
LIGHT IT
Leave exterior residence lights on at night or utilize motion detecting lights.
CLOSE IT
Keep your garage door closed and double-check it is closed at night.
HIDE IT
Keep valuables in your garage, car, and home out of sight.
REPORT IT
Report all criminal and suspicious activity immediately.

If you were scammed or think you saw a scam, report it to the Federal Trade Commission.
 
What You Can Do to Avoid a Scam
  Block unwanted calls and text messages. Take steps to block unwanted calls and to filter unwanted text messages. 
Don't give your personal or financial information in response to a request that you didn't expect. Legitimate organizations won't call, email, or text to ask for your personal information, like your Social Security, bank account, or credit card numbers. 
If you get an email or text message from a company you do business with and you think it's real, it's still best not to click on any links. Instead, contact them using a website you know is trustworthy. Or look up their phone number. Don't call a number they gave you or the number from your caller ID
Resist the pressure to act immediately. Legitimate businesses will give you time to make a decision. Anyone who pressures you to pay or give them your personal information is a scammer. 
Know how scammers tell you to pay. Never pay someone who insists you pay with a gift card or by using a money transfer service. And never deposit a check and send money back to someone. 
Stop and talk to someone you trust. Before you do anything else, tell someone -- a friend, a family member, a neighbor -- what happened. Talking about it could help you realize it's a scam.

We are appreciative of the South side resident who contact police sensing the youth needed help.

Please see the video for more detail and if you have any information regarding this incident, please contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014, or, on the web at p3tips.com
 
The Madison Area has seen several catalytic converter thefts in recent months.  Here are a few crime prevention tips:
  If possible, park in well-lit areas and close to building or building entrances.
Park in a garage, if possible and lock the doors .
Have the catalytic converter welded to your car's frame, which may make it harder to steal.  Also there are several aftermarket items that can be purchased that your certified auto mechanic can install that would prevent or help prevent the theft.
Consider engraving your vehicle identification number (VIN) on the catalytic converter.  This may assist in recovering your catalytic converter if it is stolen.
Calibrate your Car's alarm to set off when it detects vibration.  The suspects in this crime normally use a battery operation reciprocating saw and it creates a lot of noise and vibration when it is being removed.
If your able to park your vehicle in a way to limit access to the bottom of the vehicle as much as possible.
Install cameras home or vehicle that would capture the image of the suspect committing the crime.
Most importantly if you see or hear anything suspicious please notify your local law enforcement as soon as possible.

The lieutenant estimated speeds of up to 70 mph. Dane County Sheriff's deputies and Wisconsin State Troopers were able to box in the stolen car near the intersection of County Highway TT and County Highway N.
     Maysack was arrested following a high-risk stop. The car he was operating had been stolen earlier that day after a food delivery driver left it unlocked and running outside of a N. Livingston St. (Madison) address for about 30 seconds.

The roads continue to be slippery.  Motorists should also prepare by bringing extra food, water and blankets/clothing before leaving their residences should they become stranded. Given the volume of crashes, 
motorists may experience longer wait times for towing services if involved in a crash.

Remember: Wisconsin has a ""move over law"" that requires motorists to move over a lane when passing emergency vehicles (if practical) or alternately, to slow their speeds as they pass emergency vehicles.

The gunman was in a car in front of her, also waiting for a green arrow. However, when that appeared, the man did not move. The victim could see he seemed preoccupied, and was on his phone, so she honked. He still did not move. So she honked some more. Just as the light was turning yellow, he finally accelerated. She also made it through the intersection, and pulled up to the pumps. That's when she saw the man. He was now parked nearby, not getting gas, but staring at her. ""What's the problem,"" she asked. That's when he got out, and walked her way while pointing a handgun. He made several statements, including, ""I will end you.""

Based on limited information he provided, it appeared this likely occurred near Todd Dr. and McDivitt Dr. The victim said two men battered him, and took his wallet, cell phone and backpack. He was treated for a broken nose, chipped teeth, and cuts. The preliminary investigation indicates the crime was not random.

A N. Frances St. resident, a 20-year-old, certainly thought so. Sadly, stretching his legs came with a price. He had not locked his backdoor, and when he arrived home, his wallet was gone.
     However, thanks to the wonderful world of technology, he was able to determine, using his cell phone, that someone was actively using his credit card to purchases, not far away, at Walgreens, 676 State St.
     The victim ventured there, and stood behind the suspect in line, watching as he used the victim's stolen credit card to buy multiple packs of cigarettes. The 20-year-old did not engage the suspect, wanting to stay safe, but did watch as the man headed outside, handing out packs of smokes to friends.
     The young man continued to follow the suspect, but lost him as he called police.
    An officer went to the Walgreens seeking clues. Because the man had purchased cigarettes, he was required to provide a photo ID, and his image was captured on surveillance cameras.
     The officer went back outside, and soon spotted the suspect in the 500 block of State Street. Ronald Watson, age 56, Madison, told the officer he had made some purchases at Walgreens, but  did so with a credit card given to him by a guy known downtown as ""Shorty.""
""Shorty,"" said the suspect, is not allowed in Walgreens, and asked for assistance in buying some items. The officer said the story was not making sense, since Watson was still holding a Walgreens bag containing packs of cigarettes.
    The officer also used other surveillance cameras to track Watson to places very near the victim's apartment, right around the time of the burglary.
     Watson was arrested for misappropriation of personal identifying materials and felony bail jumping.
     Central District officers are aware of an individual who goes by the moniker, ""Shorty."" They located and talked with ""Shorty,"" and ""Shorty"" said he had nothing to do with any of what Watson was talking about.
     Looks like another great day for a run, but whether you live downtown or elsewhere, the MPD recommends you lock your doors.

Surveillance video indicates one got out, sneaked up to the victim's unlocked passenger door, opened it, and took the wallet. The car, occupied by the suspects, is listed as stolen out of Sun Prairie. The theft took place in the early morning hours of September 28th at the Kwik Trip, 7502 Mineral Point Rd. MPD crime analysts indicate this brings to four the number of recent similar thefts at area gas stations. Motorists are urged to lock doors, and roll up windows, while pumping gas.

The neighbor, and the nurse, reported all of this to an officer who was called to the scene.
     Several hours later, just before noon, the neighbor was calling 911 again. He was now at Brittingham Park and, lo and behold, there was the suspect sitting on a bench with the nurse's bike right next to it.
     When an officer arrived, the suspect provided a fake name, and said he had just gotten to Madison 15 days prior from Havana, Cuba via the Chicago Area. The bike, he said, he bought from a guy for ten bucks.
     Unfortunately for him, there was an eyewitness, the nurse's neighbor, and the suspect was soon on his way to jail, where he was actually booked in for stealing two bikes.
     A downtown MPD officer was able to connect Jose A. Lino, age 56, to an earlier theft thanks to surveillance cameras. They had captured Lino taking a 23-year-old man's bicycle just after midnight on August 24th. The victim had locked it to a rack in the 100 block of State St.

     The 23-year-old was out of luck, but not the nurse. With her blessing, police gave her bike to her alert neighbor who brought it back to her just hours after it was stolen.

     According to a witness, one drew a small knife while challenging the other to come get the two-wheeler.

     When the officer arrived, the mother was outside, holding her daughter. She was ""very frantic, and crying,"" according to the officer's report. ""I immediately observed (the baby), whose eyes appeared like they were bulging out of their sockets ... was not making any sounds ... and appeared very rigid in (her mother's) arms.""
     The officer asked if he could have the baby. He flipped her ""over on her belly, cradling her head in my left hand, while her body ran along my left arm. I delivered five back blows between her shoulder blades."" The officer, using two fingers, next gave the infant a series of chest compressions. He then rolled her over again, and following more back blows, the baby girl began crying. She appeared to have spit up baby formula.
The infant was taken by Madison Fire Department paramedics to an emergency room to be checked out.
     She is back home, with mom today, doing much better.

The victim's name has been widely reported by media, but it is the protocol of the MPD not to identify crime victims.
     The politician said he was walking to the State Capitol around midnight when he saw a group of demonstrators in the street. He decided to use his phone to capture what was happening. As he did, three people rushed toward him, saying something about his phone. One knocked it out of his hand. He said he was then sucker punched. He fell to the ground and was battered by several people.
     A media member, who witnessed the assault, told police approximately ten people punched and kicked the politician while he was on the ground and as the politician tried to explain that he is an ally.
     When the beating stopped, the politician tried to dialogue with his attackers, explaining who he was, and asking for his phone and glasses to be returned. They were, and someone identifying herself as a nurse came to his aid.
     Feeling ""lightheaded, stunned and dazed"" he next stumbled toward the State Capitol, where he laid down on the grass.
     He made contact with Capitol Police who called for an emergency medical response. Paramedics treated the politician, but he declined to go to a hospital.
     Capitol Police escorted him into the Capitol, and told him not to leave the building because of property damage and unruly behavior that was continuing to take place outside.
     The politician later sought medical help at a hospital. He told the MPD he was still feeling pain in his neck, arms, ribs, and head.

     Family members were able to escape, as officers arrived.
     The man came out armed with a large butcher knife. He was yelling at the officers, wanting them to shoot.
      He got in a car, and drove at a high rate of speed, directly at the officers who took cover behind trees and squad cars. The driver stopped just prior to striking a police car. He got out, still holding the knife, still yelling to be shot, as officers shouted for him to drop the weapon.
      Moments later they deployed the ECD and the sponge round. The man went to the ground, in a controlled manner, dropping the knife.
He was taken to a hospital.

     The PEO followed the Camry at a safe distance while providing updates to responding officers. He saw the suspect get out of the Camry, near the corner of S. Bedford St. and W. Wilson St., walk behind a residence, and get back in the Camry. The suspect was soon stopped by MPD officers.
     A police K9 found a loaded handgun behind the S. Bedford St. residence where the suspect had walked.
     Tyrone L. Jackson, age 53, told officers he had been in a dispute with the men in the SUV, claiming one had previously battered him. He denied having a gun at the park. Nevertheless, officer developed probable cause to arrest Jackson for second degree reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct while armed, and possession of a firearm by a felon.

It is egg laying time, and the hunt for new habitat is instinctual, yet often times dangerous.
Such was the case last Tuesday night on Industrial Drive. By the time an officer arrived, it appeared a slow moving snapping turtle, which was in the roadway, had just escaped certain death. Its shell was freshly scraped, and it appeared a passing car's undercarriage had caused damage, but no serious injury.
     The officer attempted to encourage the turtle's forward progress by pushing it with a police baton. However, snapping turtles are known for having rather combative dispositions, and true to form, this one responded by looking at the officer while repeatedly opening and shutting its powerful beak-like jaws.
     ""The turtle was also very heavy to just push,"" noted the officer. She next attempted to get it on top of a plastic sheet, with thoughts of pulling it across rain-slicked pavement. ""However the turtle's claws were very sharp and ripped up the plastic sheet,"" said the officer. It was time for backup: ""I do not have experience with moving a large snapping turtle, so I requested assistance.""
     While waiting for an officer with a more extensive wildlife background, ""I tried to use verbal commands to get the turtle to move across the road. However, the turtle continued to assess me as a threat and kept trying to snap/bite in my direction.""
     When the second officer arrived, he explained you need to move a snapping turtle by lifting it with two hands, just above the rear legs, but not by the turtle's tail as that can cause spinal damage.
     With that, the hoist was made. The turtle was now making rapid progress on its journey, yet continued to show displeasure with human contact.
     It may have been unwanted, but the initial officer was very pleased with the outcome of the safe passage, writing in her report: ""Hopefully the turtle will continue to live a long snappy life.""
She decided to name it for its behavior and home turf: ""Snappy the South Side Turtle""

     A MPD Special Events Team (SET) was away from the gathering on State Capitol grounds, giving people space to exercise their First Amendment rights. The team was ready to deploy to State Street, should looting and other violence erupt again. The following is an account from one of its members:
     ""We formed a line in front of Grace Episcopal Church, when we were approached by three protesters. As I recall, two were black men, and one was a black woman. The woman informed SET that the peaceful protest was over, and she was leaving. She went on to tell us that she would go down to the top of State Street, encourage the group to leave, and inform them that the protest was over. The woman made clear that whoever remained would know that their decision could carry a consequence. The woman then headed down to the top of State Street, and I could hear her voice in what I understood to be an attempt to speak with the group. The woman returned back to our position, and she wished SET a safe night. Her group also handed out flowers to SET officers, and I do not know an officer who turned the offer down. Many officers carried the flowers on them during the subsequent clear of State Street (after looting broke out).
     Obviously, this week has been extremely challenging for so many. I thought it was incredibly brave for these three individuals to approach the police, and offer a gesture of kindness. This demonstrated to me what almost all of us recognize - many of those in the crowd wish to lawfully express their constitutional liberties, and only a small group of people are causing the chaos we have seen. SET is absolutely committed to protecting lawful protest, and this commitment is why I joined the team. Unfortunately, SET's responsibilities to public safety limit our ability to engage in a conversation about what is happening while in hard gear, but many SET officers noted how remarkable and kind this moment was.""
     This story will likely not make headline news, but for those looking for glimmers of hope, they are out there, on our streets: in this case protesters and police sharing moments of humanity.

     In the run-up to capture, Harland E. Wallace, age 27, no permanent address, had been spotted on Rosemary Ave. driving a stolen orange Mustang convertible.
     Wallace did not stop for police, but a North District CPT member soon found the Mustang parked in the 4100 block of Bruns Ave., with a potential suspect entering a nearby home.
     Several people were ordered out of the residence. None claimed to know anything about the whereabouts of Wallace, but the home's owner did give the MPD permission to search for him.
     K9 Bowie arrived at the scene, and several loud pronouncements were made into the home, letting anyone inside know that either they come out, or police were coming in, with Bowie – who was now barking loudly – leading the way.
     Bowie showed little interest in most rooms, until arriving at the bathroom. At first blush it did not appear anyone was inside, until an officer used a foot to crack the vanity door, and therein was Wallace.
     A handgun and drugs were also found in the home. Those who had voluntarily cleared out, prior to Wallace's arrest, said the items did not belong to them.
     Wallace has been tentatively charged with operating a motor vehicle without owner's consent, knowingly fleeing an officer, and bail jumping.
     On a side note, K9 Bowie is named for the late British singer and songwriter, David Bowie, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.

-In the wake of her tragic death, the family of Brittany Zimmermann has announced that they are establishing a scholarship in Brittany's name and conducting a fund drive called ""Dollars for Brittany"". A Marshfield credit union is facilitating the collection of funds.

Contributions can be sent to:

Brittany Zimmermann Memorial Fund
C/O Marshfield Medical Center CU
PO Box 279
Marshfield, WI 54449



(UPDATED Monday, April 14, 2008)

The Madison Police Department is seeking additional information from people who were in the Bassett Neighborhood either on the day Brittany was killed, or on the day before her death. Specifically, detectives would like to speak with anyone who was solicited for money – or gave money to strangers - on either April 1st or April 2nd. This would include citizens who were approached on the street, or at their homes, by one or more individuals. Investigators are focusing this effort on solicitations that were made on West Washington Ave., West Main St., West Wilson St., South Bedford St., South Bassett St., or West Doty Street. The MPD would ask those with information to call Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014.


(UPDATED FRIDAY APRIL 11, 2008)

Posters seeking information in the Brittany Sue Zimmermann case will soon be posted by Madison Police Officers in the Bassett Neighborhood, and in other areas of the central city. A copy of the poster has been attached to this incident report.

Madison Crime Stoppers has now received approximately 200 tips in the Zimmermann case. In addition, some 25 new tips have come in reference the Joel Marino homicide. Joel was murdered on January 28th, and prior to Brittany’s homicide around 70 tips had been received in the Marino investigation.

There are some similarities in the cases. Both residents were killed inside their homes, during daylight hours, and no motive has been established in either case. There appears to be nothing in either victim’s background that would make them targets of violence.

Still, investigators do not know if the cases are connected, and there are differences. For example, in the Zimmermann case there were signs of forced entry. There was no evidence of forced entry in the Marino case.

Both Marino and Zimmermann lived in close proximity, perhaps a mile or so apart. Because of the closeness detectives working the Marino case are coming across information that may help the Zimmermann case. Conversely, detectives working the Zimmermann case are coming across information that may aid the Marino probe.

Both cases remain very active investigations.





(UPDATED MONDAY APRIL 7)

Some members of the media have been inquiring about a man who was going to various locations in the downtown (including a residence on West Washington Avenue) soliciting money from residents on the day of Brittany's death. This person is in custody on a probation hold, and is one of many who have been arrested (for things like probation holds and unrelated crimes) during the Zimmermann investigation. No suspect has been identified in the murder of Brittany. Detectives are continuing to pursue a plethora of leads. The MPD appreciates all of those who have come forward with information, and encourages others to call Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014 as this remains a very active investigation.

(UPDATED PRESS INFORMATION: RELEASED FRIDAY APRIL 4, 2008)

The Madison Police Department, with assistance from the WI State Crime Laboratory, continued Friday to process the home of Brittany Sue Zimmermann.

Forensic analysts at the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory in Madison are already expediting the examination of some items found that may have evidentiary value.

Meanwhile, the focus of the investigation continues on several fronts. Patrol officers and detectives have been talking with numerous people in the neighborhood including residents, commuters, business owners, and transients. Police are seeking to speak with those who are willing to share information, and those who may be somewhat reluctant to contact police directly. Police seek any information regarding activity in the area.

In the Zimmermann case, the MPD would like citizens to focus on the daytime – going into the nighttime hours -- of Wednesday April 2nd. If anyone saw anything odd, strange, or out of the ordinary in the area of the crime scene—a call to Crime Stoppers (608-266-6014) would be appreciated.

In the last 24 hours more than 75 tips have come in to Crime Stoppers. Many of those calls are from people who have had strangers come to their doors, or into their homes recently, or over the course of the past several months. Several callers said at the time they did not call police. The MPD would urge anyone, at anytime, encountering a similar situation to call.

Other tips in the Zimmermann investigation have come from downtown residents who saw people going door to door asking for money on the day of the homicide. In at least one case a man entered a residence. Investigators have identified many of these people, and have talked with them. It is not unusual during such contacts that arrests are made for unrelated matters. For instance, some contacts are made with those who may have outstanding warrants, or are wanted on probation holds.

At this hour the MPD does not have a suspect, or suspects identified in the Zimmermann homicide. The Dane County Coroner has determined Brittany died from a “complexity of traumatic injuries.” Investigators have not established a motive.

Madison and UW police officers will continue increased foot patrols in the Bassett Street Neighborhood.









(UPDATED THURSDAY APRIL 3 @ 12:20 p.m.)

Investigators in the Brittany Zimmermann homicide have concluded that her boyfriend is not a suspect in this case.

He has been -- and continues to be -- very helpful in providing information to the detective team.

Many leads have come in, and detectives are pursuing them. No suspect has been identified.

The search of Brittany's home -- and the area around it -- continues. Items of possible evidentiary value are being taken to the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory in Madison for analysis.

A member of the Dane County's Victim/Witness unit is working with Brittany's family. She will be keeping them posted on developments in the case, and has informed the MPD that the family is asking for privacy as they continue to grieve.

A good number of tips have come in to the MPD, and citizens with any information that may help lead to an arrest are encouraged to continue to call the Madison Police Crime Stoppers line at 608-266-6014.

--------------------------------------------

(ORIGINAL RELEASE)
Shortly after 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday Madison Police were called to a residence in the 500 block of West Doty Street to check on a person. Ms. Zimmermann was found dead inside her home. Dane County Coroner John Stanley says a preliminary examination indicates the manner of death was homicide.

The Madison Police Department is working in unison with the UW-Madison Police Department on this case, and a Command Post has been established inside the Central District station.

Both Madison Police Chief Noble Wray, and UW Police Chief Susan Riseling have pledged extra patrols, and a heightened presence on Doty Street and surrounding areas for the time being.

At this writing no suspects have been identified, and detectives have been unable to rule out that this may have been a random act.

District Alderman Mike Verveer is looking to hold a community meeting this weekend to address concerns of residents.

Meanwhile, a team of detectives will work the case around the clock, with patrol officers aiding in their efforts.

Coroner Stanley has indicated a forensic examination will be done tomorrow morning at which time he may (or may not -- depending on consultation with investigators) release more information on the cause of death.

""This terrible crime is a tragedy, and my thoughts are with the victim's family and friends,"" said Mayor Dave Cieslewicz. ""I am going to work closely with the Madison Police Department and other law enforcement authorities to provide the resources necessary to bring the perpetrator to justice and address the public safety needs of the community

     Elgin D. Jackson, age 33, Madison, was arrested for a parole violation while detectives determine which tentative charges he will face for Thursday afternoon's crime spree.
     It started when a MPD officer attempted to contact Jackson in an apartment complex parking lot in the 1300 block of MacArthur Rd. Jackson was parked, and behind the wheel of his car. He disregarded the officer's repeated attempts to stop trying to drive from the area. In order to escape, Jackson ended up striking the squad, and another car, which was parked in the lot. He just missed hitting the officer, who was out of the squad, and several innocent bystanders, including a child on a scooter.
     Jackson then raced at speeds in excess of 75 mph from Mendota St. to East Washington Ave., where he totaled his car after striking the center median.
     Jackson ran from the scene, but as aforementioned, was spotted by a witness getting into a trash bin on Hoover Dr.
     The community and police working together: a suspect could run; he could hide, but he still got caught.

     It began yesterday morning when a passerby spotted a German Shepherd wandering along railroad tracks near Autumn Leaf Lane.
     Officers attempted to corral the runaway, but she was skittish, and took off into a large field, surrounded by woods.
     Around the same time, a woman was reporting a missing dog, a German Shepherd named Anika. She's nine-years-old, and belongs to the woman's father. He was in the hospital for surgery, and she was carrying for Anika, until Tuesday, when Anika bolted out of an open door. The owner's daughter and a friend spent the better part of the night searching, but to no avail.
     Soon the daughter was working with the officers. A MPD drone operator was brought in, but power lines prevented good aerial surveillance.
     At some point, the daughter needed to drop from the search party in order to go pick up her dad, who was being discharged.
    During her absence, officers continued the hunt, finally spotting Anika down by a creek. They kept a close eye on her for over an hour, but did not want to too close for fear of spooking Anika again.
     Soon, father and daughter were with the officers: dad still clad in his hospital pajamas and slippers. All worked in concert to get Anika back on a leash.
     Coming off surgery, having a man's best friend back to help with recuperation was very much appreciated. So much so, the owner offered the officers a handsome reward: Green Bay Packers tickets.
     Accepting gratuities is not something they can do, but just being part of a good deed, putting smiles on faces, restored the officers' belief that humanity and hope are still present even during times when so much seems so uncertain.

     The welder had been stolen from Northern Tool and Equipment, 2118 W. Beltline Highway. An employee had chased after two suspects. The worker was kicked and pushed by the men, who threatened to further ""beat"" the employee if he did not back off.
     The thieves continued to run, hiding the welder along the way, likely with hopes of retrieving it at a later time.
     The suspects had originally arrived in a getaway car, but it never made it out of the Northern Tool parking lot. A community member, who was outside in his vehicle, saw the original thief running from the store, carrying the welder, with an employee in hot pursuit. He realized the thief was running toward the getaway car, and that the getaway car would be stuck if he used his own vehicle to block the lot's exit. And so that's what he did, and it worked.         
     However the thief, and a passenger who got out of the getaway car, took off on foot, leaving a somewhat naïve 17-year-old behind the wheel. He did not try to run off, and readily admitted to making a very poor decision by taking part in the crime. He was very apologetic saying to police saying he does not know the other young men well, and that one had offered to pay him if he would drive them to get some food.  
     An officer counseled the teen on choosing more trustworthy friends.
     Officers have surveillance video and are working at identifying the thieves. The cooperative 17-year-old has not been arrested at this point.

     The victim was at Danny's Pub, 328 W. Gorham St. when the theft took place. She soon learned her debit card was successfully used at Capitol Centre Market, 111 N. Broom St., where the suspect's image was captured on video surveillance.
     By Sunday afternoon, the victim could see her phone tracking somewhere in the Eken Park neighborhood. She and her mother realized there was Boost Mobile store in the area, and went there. They told a clerk about the situation, provided information about the stolen phone, and asked the employee to please contact them if someone arrived trying to sell it.
It was the beginning of a successful dragnet. The suspect arrived with the stolen phone. The clerk inspected it, and used it to text the victim's mother. She then stalled the suspect, giving mom and daughter time to arrive.
    There was an animated verbal exchange between involved parties prompting the employee to call 911.
The suspect, who told the victim and her mother they were crazy, that he had done nothing wrong, tried to leave. Mom stepped in front of the door and locked it. She said the suspect next struck her with an open hand and pushed her down. He tried to leave again. Seeing this scenario from her car seat, the mother's younger daughter, raced toward the store's door and pushed it shut from the outside.
     By this time, mom was calling for help, and a couple of passersby intervened, all working to keep the suspect inside until officers arrived.
     Eric A. Eisenhauer, age 51, Madison, claimed to have found the phone in the street. He was arrested for battery, disorderly conduct, receiving stolen property, misappropriation of personal identifying materials, and felony bail jumping.
     Officers had immediately recognized Eisenhauer as surveillance images from Capitol Centre Market had previously been shared with patrol.

Here in Madison, a 41-year-old downtown resident, a deer hunter, notifies the MPD that his rifle has been stolen from his 1966 GMC truck that was unlocked and parked on S. Baldwin St.
     The victim had left the gun beneath a blanket in the truck's bed. It was no ordinary weapon, rather a German Mauser, regarded as one of the finest military bolt action rifles in history: standard issue for the Nazis in World War II.  
     Official police reports of the Mauser theft have been maintained for decades at the MPD, even though the case had been long since cold.
     And, there's good reason for keeping good records.
    On January 28th of this year, a MPD property clerk was contacted by a police detective from Circleville Ohio, about 25 miles south of Columbus.
     The detective said someone had turned in a German Mauser. The serial number indicated it had been stolen in Madison.
     The rifle, in an evidence box, has now just been shipped to the MPD's Property Room.
     It has now been determined the gun's owner passed away in 1998.
     However, his children are still alive, and are being contacted 47 years after their dad reported the crime.
     Lil Nas X's ""Old Town Road"" featuring Billy Ray Cyrus recently topped the charts. Donald Trump is now the U.S. President, and the bolt action Mauser, stolen in '73, is back in Madison.

The driver and one passenger took off on foot, while a second passenger stayed with the disabled car. All were taken into custody as several officers swarmed the area. A MPD investigator had spotted the speeding stolen car on the West Beltline Highway. He did not chase it, but was calling out its position as he followed at a distance from behind. The sergeant saw the stolen car coming, with no other vehicles – save for the investigator's squad car, in sight. He took the opportunity to lay spike strips down. The car had been stolen on December 6th after its owner left it running, and warming up, in front of his Westover Court home. The driver and his passengers (a 12-year-old boy from McFarland, and a 14-year-old boy from Madison) were all taken to the Juvenile Reception Center.

# Incident Reports in Madison, WI: Project Overview

+ Exploratory Analysis of the City of Madison's Incident Reports
+ Scraped over 2,000 Incident Reports using Selenium and Python. 

## Resources and Versions
**Python Version**: 3.10
**Packages/Modules**: pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, selenium, seaborn, shapely
**Data Source**: https://www.cityofmadison.com/police/newsroom/incidentreports/

### Note: City of Madison states that Incident Reports are not indicative of all crimes, so interpret findings with this in mind.

## Web Scraping:
To gather all of this data, I built a scraper from scratch, using Selenium, in order to pull data from the city's website.
With each incident, the following information is gathered:
  + Release Date of Report
  + Type of Incident
  + Case Number
  + Address of Incident
  + Name of person that released report
  + Date the Incident Report was updated (if it ever was)
